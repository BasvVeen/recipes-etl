In order to run the code you need to open it in the interpreter/editor of your choice. I personally used PyCharm but Spyder or Anaconda work as well. To install the packages/libraries utilised open the terminal belonging to your Python environment.

In the terminal, download and install the packages using the following command : pip install .... 

Wait untill the previous one is installed in your Python environment and repeat the process untill all of the packages are installed. 


### Python version used
I have used Python version 3.9.18
