### Packages used
- pandas

In order to run the code you need to open it in the interpreter/editor of your choice. I personally used PyCharm but Spyder or Anaconda work as well. To install the packages/libraries utilised open the terminal belonging to your Python environment.

In the terminal, download and install the packages using the following command : pip install .... (the package name on the place of the dots).

Wait untill the previous one is installed in your Python environment and repeat the process untill all of the packages are installed. 


### Python version used
I have used Python version 3.9.18.

### How to run

To run the ETL, open the ETL.py file in your interpreter and make sure all of the packages are installed and that the recipes.json file is present in the same directory as the .py file. Then connect your interpreter to the Python environment in which you installed the necessary packages. Then run the file, it will create the .csv file in the same directory as the .py file.
